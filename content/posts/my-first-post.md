My name is Tim McHale. I started learning how to code back in 2014. I wanted to become a developer at the time, but instead worked other jobs in tech, like Data Analysis and Sales. 

Looking back at my github I see some early projects that got me excited about software, connecting to the Twitter API to search ISIS tweets(a hot story at the time), python algorithms to search genetic strings in the human genome. They look like misfit toys to me now. However, the coronavirus lockdown has given me some solitude, and perspective - this winter I am finishing the CS degree I started in 2014.

The purpose of the blog is to detail my journey with advanced computer science...
